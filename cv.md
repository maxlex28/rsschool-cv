## **OBJECTIVE**

Solid experience in management of technical assistance for filmmaking. Great interest
in business analysis.
I am seeking for a challenging job in management of the sphere of technical assistance
for film- and video production and related areas. Being a beginner in Python
programming with high ambitions to promote in this field (with application of knowledge
and skills in the field of data analysis), I see any improvement being possible only with
taking high bars set by yourself. I have significant experience in management of
material resources and considerable competency in HR -management in a highly
competitive market of film and video production, where consumer (client) traditionally
_"calls the shots"_.
Ready to relocate to another country.
